# Submission for the VAST 2023 Mini-Challenge 1

## Demo

Visit http://52.215.84.45:1234/ for a live demo.

_Caveat: The demo takes a couple seconds to load. Also, it does not show the overview graph because I was unable to remotely host Neo4j. However, the overview panel is of minor importance and is not needed for interactive graph exploration with FishLense._
